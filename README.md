# CameraX Image and video analyzer on Android
CameraX Experiments using CameraX API with Kotlin.

## Purpose 
To play with Android CameraX: the Jetpack library that helps make camera app development easier. It provides a consistent, easy-to-use API that works across the vast majority of Android devices, with backward-compatibility to Android 5.0 (API level 21). For an overview of `CameraX`, check out https://developer.android.com/training/camerax.

## What can CameraX do?
1) CameraX includes basic camera funcationalities such as image capture, video capture, video snapshot, capture preview, image and video save.
2) In addition, there is also an Extensions API that allows you to access features such as bokeh, high dynamic range (HDR), night mode, face retouching etc.
3) CameraX's image analysis use case provides CPU-accessible images on which you can perform image processing, computer vision, or machine learning inference. To learn how to integrate Google's ML Kit with your CameraX app, see [ML Kit Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/mlkitanalyzer).
4) Thanks to the `automated CameraX test lab that tests a variety of camera behaviors across a range of devices and all operating system versions`, CameraX makes it easy to work on a wide range of android devices.
